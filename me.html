      <p style="color:white; text-align:center;"> My goal is still to be the best programmer I can be. I am interested in mobile application development. Recently, I have been excited about working with augmented and virtual reality. I have developed prototype augmented reality applications. My Video Game Design group developed a virtual reality game with a complete story. In the future I would like to work for myself. My main motivation is to be able to set my own work hours. I also really enjoy creating original projects that represent me.</p>

      <h2 style="color:grey">about</h2>
      <p style="color:white; text-align:center;">I was born in houston. Raised in Pearland. As a kid I strived to do my very best in school. I have played basketball, soccer, and finished high school on the varsity football team. I was involved in many different clubs and organizations. While in the Pearland Youth Action Council, I obtained many volunteer hours and worked closely with city council. During my senior year of high school, I co-founded my schoolâ€™s African American Culture Club. My main hobbies were weight lifting and making short films. Next it was time to move onto louisiana state university to purse a degree in computer science. Tutoring, supplemental instruction sessions, and group study aided my success at lsu. I also transitioned into a long boarder to get around campus. Boarding was a lifestyle choice that I have yet to regret. I attended many different clubs to stay active while searching for the best career path to take. Outside of class i learned how to time manage work, cooking, and social life.

      <h2 style="color:grey">lifestyle</h2>
      <p>I am excited to see where the boarding lifestyle will take me. I have influenced five people to start long boarding. Everyone enjoys it as much as I do. I will continue to develop my longboard dancing skills. I have to develop my beat matching skills to become a better DJ. I am not as excited to DJ parties or clubs as I am to just make mixes for myself and others to enjoy. I also strive to step my fashion game up. I am currently not sure what exactly that will look like, but I am taking notes from modern day influencers.</p>
